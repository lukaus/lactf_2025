I had an absolute blast doing this! It was my first CTF ever, and I did it solo, so I wasn't really expecting to get a single solve. Thankfully, the challenge difficulty began well within my range in all of the categories. I learned a TON, and the CTF gave me a chance to discover and play with a lot of new tools, like [python-pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) and [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), as well as brush up on some I haven't used in a while, like [gdb](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/). Definitely excited to do more of these in the future and learn even more.
